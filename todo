Frontend:
    Bugs:
        - Make styles work
        - Dates need to be parsed nicely

    To do:
        - Be able to build for previous days via cli arg
        - Maybe like a misty pastel background
        - Choose day for date options
        - And it will roll you to that day?
        - Minimal view with more of a spreadsheet look
        - Spreadsheet showtimes view?
        - nice mobile version
        - Filter by time
            - Automatically filter by current time

Backend:
    Bugs:
        - Metrograph handle multiple times
    To do:
        - wburg cinema
        - Generate html files for all dates

General:
    - How is date filtering going to work
    - Set up script to run daily (github actions?)

Thoughts:
    - Maybe everything should just be daily, and you can select which day you want (maybe pre-generate all that html)
        - Maybe the date and change date button stick to the top when you scroll down
